    <h2>About Project24</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
        This is <b>Project24</b> (or more precisely, <b>Project24b</b>), a web application that I made out of free time
        while waiting for the 2023 Monbukagakusho (MEXT) scholarship's Secondary Screening result.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project started out on 31 August 2022 as "<i>Project24</i>", after I had enough with how my father manage his
        clinic. During the first 4 weeks after that, I have to scrapped many planned features due to my lack of skill in
        this field, but I managed to added another big feature on the other hand. On 3rd October I decided to change the
        project to be <i>my</i> NAS manager and demote my father's clinic manager to be a "feature", renaming the project
        to be "<i>Project24b</i>".
    </p>
    <p>
        If you landed on this About page, you must have been <i>my father</i>, <i>my mother</i>, <i>my brother</i>,
        one of my approved-NAS-user, or you just happened to land here through Google Search. Regardless of who you are,
        I hope you find our resource useful and have a good time here.
